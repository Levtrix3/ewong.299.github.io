            <h2> Observational Notes and pre-planning</h2>

            <p> 1. After skimming the text: Starts off graphic, I almost imagine blood and stains, tearing. Then it gets soft, light and peaceful since shes realizing how she feel sin the moment. Very up down movement with the way she speaks of horomones but ends up at one point with the way she brings all the hormones to a reason. Another way I viewed this was it was very personal, like handwriting text came to mind when reading this and how I'd envision the text. The text is very descriptive and emotional almost to the point where it nearly sounded angry in the begining but the anger fades out into frustration then into an understanding and accepting tone.</p>

            <p> 2. Words that caught my attention: The words anxiety, hormones, and a variety of decriptive words are used in her own opinionated way. (just pointed this part out due to how personal the text is)</p>
            
            <p> 3. Important content: Things I would point out would probably be the frustration in the begining to the transition to a more descriptive but understanding flow and end it off with acceptance. ( I don't know how to describe this properly)</p>

            <h4> Ideas I have so far ( In no particuar order):</h4>
            <p> 1. Diary Entry : Handwriting like text/ type writer text.</p>
            <p> 2. A Self Social Media page: Her text in different boxes of tweets/ entries. It can also look like a reddit page.</p>
            <p> 3. Tight and Loose text: Dermining frustration.</p>
            <p> 4. Hanging larger texts of quotes, this would be for the more opinionated text.</p>
            <p> 5. Hover effects over certain words for effects, or scroll to rematch words in the next box of text.</p>
            <p> 6. One instabce of dripping text that falls and causes a water splash effect.</p>
            <p> 7. Typing effect to seem as though she it typing the text herself.</p>
