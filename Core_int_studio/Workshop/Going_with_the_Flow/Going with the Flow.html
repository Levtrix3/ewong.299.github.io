                    <p>In the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I looked around at all the women in the carriage. Middle-aged women hurtling towards the suburbs. Pregnant women holding their lower backs. Teenage girls slick with sebum. Elderly women standing stoically by the doors. I realised every one of them will have some story about how their reproductive systems have affected their lives. And I thought: 
                    </p>
                    <p><i>How much have you kept secret?</i></p>
                </div>
                <br>
                </br>

                <div style="width: 600pt;
                    background-color: whitesmoke;
                    border-style: inset;
                    padding: 10pt;">
                    <p>Because one day in our early lives as women, everything changes. We start bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a child. I was on a crazy golf course overlooking Cromer pier when I experienced period pain for the first time. My lower body rippled with a new sensation. It was a pain that didn’t fit inside my body, burning through my thighs. I explained to Dad that I didn’t feel well. I was aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a way that I absolutely did not have the language for. That British coastal perfume, thick with sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea that came with these sharp churns to another level. I had to sit down on the grass. The pain spoke to me. It told me my human fabric had changed. As evidence of the encoding that happened, now when I hear seagulls, I still have flash visions of lying down holding my belly.</p>

                    <p>I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a physical and mental slog. It is thought that 90% of women experience some premenstrual changes, even if mildly. There are more than 150 clinically identified symptoms of PMS, including irritability, anxiety, depression and headaches. A laugh riot, in other words</p>
