            <h2> Observational Notes and pre-planning</h2>

            <p> 1. After skimming the text: Starts off graphic, I almost imagine blood and stains, tearing. Then it gets soft, light and peaceful since shes realizing how she feel sin the moment. Very up down movement with the way she speaks of horomones but ends up at one point with the way she brings all the hormones to a reason. Another way I viewed this was it was very personal, like handwriting text came to mind when reading this and how I'd envision the text. The text is very descriptive and emotional almost to the point where it nearly sounded angry in the begining but the anger fades out into frustration then into an understanding and accepting tone.</p>

            <p> 2. Words that caught my attention: The words anxiety, hormones, and a variety of decriptive words are used in her own opinionated way. (just pointed this part out due to how personal the text is)</p>
            
            <p> 3. Important content: Things I would point out would probably be the frustration in the begining to the transition to a more descriptive but understanding flow and end it off with acceptance. ( I don't know how to describe this properly)</p>

            <p> 4. Terms and references: Frustration, Anxiety, "it made me realise how entrenched my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour was in more general ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a woman.", "seriously" ( end of text)</p>
