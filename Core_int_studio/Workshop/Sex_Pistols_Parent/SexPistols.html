        <h2>Who were the Sex Pistols?</h2>
    

        <p>
          The Sex Pistols are a band I came across while digging into the history of punk music and punk culture. Originally I had started the search through the name of a store called <i>Search and Destroy</i> located in the lower east side of Manhattan. I frequent the store pretty often in hopes to find a cool jacket or any hidden gems in the store. Out of curiosity and deep infatuation with the store, I attempted to google the store online in hopes to find an 'aboutpage' I stumbled across the Sex Pistols. Let's make one thing clear, I had known about the Sex Pistols for a while, being submerged in the punk scene since I was in middle school...it was kinda hard not to stumble across such a well known band.</p>

          <p>Now, I am not the biggest fan of their music (Quite frankly, their only good songs in my opinion were the covers they did)...I am just interested in the type of things they did. They were well-known for a reason ya know. 
          The Sex Pistols were a British Punk Rock band that was heavily involved in the contribution of the British Punk Movement in the late 70s. The band was very controversial at the time and became a noteable symbol of controvery in the United Kingdom. One of their most known songs <b>God Save the Queen</b> was considered so offensive in terms of accusations towards the Uk government that it was banned from broadcasting.
