            <h2> Hotel Chelsea</h2>
            <p> One of the biggest interests I have with the sex pistols is the story of Sid and Nancy. I've always heard it refered to as a harley quinn and Joker type of love story but when I found out what actually happened I was shocked. This hotel, like many, is basically haunted. Theres no way you are going to tell me its not. This is where Nancy Spugen was found stabbed and deceased in room 100. Allegedly killed by her boyfriend Sid Vicious, but I wasn't there and the cops were practically unreliable back in the 70s so it is still considered a mystery.</p>

            <h2> Vivienne Westwood </h2>
            <p> The Sex Pistols manager Malcom McLauren, had originally named the band to promote his clothing store <i>Sex</i> which Vivienne Westood had a part in. They basically shaped punk fashion even though the boutique itself only lasted two years with that title. Vivienne Westwood then forged this punk aesthetic and refined it as her own, making a name for herself in the fashion industry. Some of her older pieces are seen on Sex Pistol members.</p>

            <h2> Search and Destroy</h2>
            <p> Located at the heart of the remains of NYC punk nightlife, this shop sells the most unique gems and pieces that follow punk fashion. The decor in the shop is no joke either, sometimes people like to go just to see the grotesque imagery and visuals all around. (Not for the faint of heart) Aside from this shop, the whole street gives off an old punk aesthetic.</p>
